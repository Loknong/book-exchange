        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          TURNiX was born out of a simple yet profound idea: books are meant to
          be shared. Whether you're a passionate reader, a casual browser, or
          someone looking to declutter your bookshelf, TURNiX provides the
          perfect space to exchange books with others who share your literary
          interests. We understand that every book has a story, not just in its
          pages but also in the hands it passes through. Our platform is
          designed to honor that journey.
