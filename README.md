# 2nd-book-exchange

I need to check I create API fully complete or not so don't give me code but list and and group API to me (to separate file later)
My app is book exchange first user visit our app user will land to landing page that show some info about our app, then visit book shelf that is main page this page is show all book, with can search by title , .... method, and filter by genre and newest oldert, at right have ranking book, for each genre top 10 show ,
this is detail for guest user, user can click book card that show in shelf to see book detail, this book card will show, title, view genre, next If user interest that book will have offer button if user not login will redirect to login page, this login page will bring user to authentication, login or signup .... , after user complete auth will redirect back to that book page, but if user come from another page will re direct to shelf page,
next user can make offer, by click make offer will have form offer after complete will send that info and notification to owner book, I forgot one part
if user login will have user panel to manage 1) user profile, 2) add book, will add book to user's inventory, 3) user inventory to see all book that user add to system, 4) manage book stage -> to manage book like this book public to exchange system or not
and last is transaction and offer this page will see transaction detail and offer detail for all
so after user interest book he make offer by click that book card in shelf then redirect to that book card detail read some description of that book that click Make offer button

this will notification to owner in his offer owner can see offer card appear he can see offer detail and can Accept that or Reject if Recject will notification back to offerer If Accept will notification back to so we going to transaction process
in transaction process will have admin in this process and another person.
after accept will have another confirm for both in transaction menu if both said yes
will have paid and Location of admin to both user , if user complete payment detail next they need to send book back to admin then admin (our company) then admin will manage the book from user // NOTE after all complete offer section and going to transaction, system will create uniqueId this Id need to come with book, so admin can check book and know this book is what book comfrom what offerId

This is my concept you can improve
